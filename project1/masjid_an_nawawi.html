        <p>Al-Masjid an-Nabawi (Arabic: المسجد النبوي, lit. 'The Prophetic Mosque'), known in English as the Prophet's Mosque, is a mosque built by the Islamic prophet Muhammad in the city of Medina in the Al Madinah Province of Saudi Arabia. It was the second mosque built by Muhammad in Medina, after Quba Mosque, and is the second largest mosque and second holiest site in Islam, both titles ranking after the Masjid al-Haram in Mecca. The mosque is located at the heart of Medina and is a major pilgrimage site that falls under the purview of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques.</p>
