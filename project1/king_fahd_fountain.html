        <p>The fountain was donated to the city of Jeddah by King Fahd, hence its name. It was constructed between 1980 and 1983 and was launched in 1985.[2]

            Located on the west coast of Saudi Arabia, the fountain jets water to a maximum height of 260 metres (853 ft).[3][4][5] The second-tallest is the World Cup Fountain in Seoul, South Korea, with a water height of 202 m (663 ft).
            
            King Fahd's Fountain is listed in Guinness World Records as the highest water fountain in the world.[6]
            
            The fountain is visible throughout the vicinity of Jeddah. The water ejected can reach a speed of 375 km/h (233 mph) and its airborne mass can exceed 16 tonnes (18 short tons).[6] The fountain uses saltwater taken from the Red Sea instead of freshwater. Over 500 LED spotlights illuminate the fountain at night.</p>
